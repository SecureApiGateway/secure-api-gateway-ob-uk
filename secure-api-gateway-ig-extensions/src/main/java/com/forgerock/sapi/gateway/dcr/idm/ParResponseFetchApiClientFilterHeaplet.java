/**
 * Heaplet for creating a ParResponseFetchApiClientFilter, this is an alias for the AuthorizeResponseFetchApiClientFilter
 * that has been configured to retrieve the client_id from the HTTP Request's Form.
 *
 * Mandatory config:
 * - idmGetApiClientBaseUri: the base uri used to build the IDM query to get the apiClient, the client_id is expected
 * to be appended to this uri (and some query params).
 * - clientHandler: the clientHandler to use to call out to IDM (must be configured with the credentials required to
 * query IDM)
 * <p>
 * Example config:
 * {
 *   "comment": "Add ApiClient data to the context attributes for the AS /par route",
 *   "name": "ParResponseFetchApiClientFilter",
 *   "type": "ParResponseFetchApiClientFilter",
 *   "config": {
 *     "idmGetApiClientBaseUri": "https://&{identity.platform.fqdn}/openidm/managed/apiClient",
 *     "clientHandler": "IDMClientHandler"
