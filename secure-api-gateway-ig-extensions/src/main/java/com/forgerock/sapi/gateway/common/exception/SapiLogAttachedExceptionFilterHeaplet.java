 * For Secure API Gateway we are aliasing this filter as SapiLogAttachedExceptionFilter. We want to control where
 * the filter gets installed in a filter chain.
 *
 * The default installation in the Router causes us to have output which includes an invalid transactionId due to it
 * being before the filter that sets the transactionId for Secure API Gateway.
 *
 * The default installation still remains and this will handle any exceptions that are raised in between the 2 filters.
